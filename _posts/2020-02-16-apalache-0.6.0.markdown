We have just released [version 0.6.0][apalache-0.6.0] of the Apalache model
checker for [TLA+][tla] :sunglasses:. Over the last six months, we have been
refactoring the tool :construction_worker: to make the whole translation to SMT
cleaner and more efficient. The new features can be found in
[CHANGELOG][release-changelog]. As we have found from the performance
benchmarks, the new release is much faster at [bounded model checking][bmc] and
proving [inductive invariants][indinv] :racehorse:.

For the first time, we have issued the [user manual][apalache-manual]
:blue_book:.  It is probably far from perfect, but it is a start! We also tried
to make the tool as easy to install as possible, so now you can just pull a
[docker image][apalache-docker] :ship: and run the model checker, the details are in
the [manual][manual-docker].

Github statistics show that there is a lot of interest in the manual, but few
people go beyond the manual page and try the tool :see_no_evil:. This is
probably due to lack of good examples that demonstrate the value of [TLA+][tla]
and [Apalache][apalache-0.6.0].

Check this blog for the upcoming examples of how one can specify distributed
algorithms with [TLA+][tla] and exercise them with [TLC][tlc] and
[Apalache][apalache-0.6.0] :hatching_chick:.
