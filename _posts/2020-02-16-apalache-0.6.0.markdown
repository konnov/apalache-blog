We have just released [version 0.6.0][apalache-0.6.0] of the Apalache model
checker for [TLA+][tla]. Over the last six months, we have been refactoring the
tool to make the whole translation to SMT cleaner and more efficient. The new
features can be found in [CHANGELOG][release-changelog]. As we have found from
the performance benchmarks, the new release is much better at [bounded model
checking][bmc] and proving [inductive invariants][indinv].

For the first time, we have issued the [user manual][apalache-manual]. It is
probably far from perfect, but it is a start! We also tried to make the tool as
easy to install as possible, so now you can just pull a [docker
image][apalache-docker] and run the model checker, the details are in the
[manual][manual-docker].

Github statistics show that there is a lot of interest in the manual, but few
people go beyond the manual page and try the tool. I believe that we need
good examples to demonstrate the value of [TLA+][tla] in general and to explain
the value of [Apalache][apalache-0.6.0].

Check this blog for the upcoming examples of how one can specify distributed
algorithms with [TLA+][tla] and exercise them with [TLC][tlc] and
[Apalache][apalache-0.6.0].
